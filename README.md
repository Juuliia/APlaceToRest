# APlaceToRest
A Place To Rest is a personal project that I am developing to explore and refine my skills as a game developer. In this game, players enter a tranquil and immersive environment designed to offer a peaceful experience. At first glance, the game appears serene and calming, but as players delve deeper and uncover the main objective, they may encounter darker themes and more complex elements.

Developed using C#, APlaceToRest is an ongoing project that may receive updates and improvements over time. While the game currently showcases a serene atmosphere, the underlying objectives introduce a more nuanced and potentially darker narrative as players progress.

Please note that APlaceToRest was created using free assets and is intended for educational purposes and personal enjoyment. I kindly request that you do not republish or redistribute the game in any form. It is meant for free use only, and any commercial use or distribution is not permitted. Your feedback is greatly appreciated, as it helps me continue to develop and enhance the game. Thank you for your support and understanding!
