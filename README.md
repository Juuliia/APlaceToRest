# APlaceToRest
A Place To Rest is a small, personal project that I am developing to explore and refine my skills as a game developer. In this game, players enter a tranquil and immersive environment designed to offer a peaceful experience. At first glance, the game appears serene and calming, but as players delve deeper and uncover the main objective, they may encounter darker themes and more complex elements.

Developed using C#, A Place To Rest will not receive further updates, as the project was primarily created to gain experience and improve my skills. While the game showcases a serene atmosphere, the underlying objectives introduce a more nuanced and potentially darker narrative as players progress.

Please note that the game was created using free assets and is intended for educational purposes and personal enjoyment. I kindly request that you do not republish or redistribute the game in any form. It is meant for free use only, and any commercial use or distribution is not permitted. Your feedback is greatly appreciated, as it has helped me in my learning process. Thank you for your support and understanding!
